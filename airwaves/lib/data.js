    description:
      "Towards the end of his life, visionary artist, filmmaker and activist Derek Jarman moved to Dungeness in Kent. There, on the shingle, around his small fisherman’s cottage, he created an iconic garden which has become a potent symbol of his legacy. This month Prospect Cottage and its garden were saved from a private buyer following the largest ever arts crowdfunding campaign by the Art Fund. This programme draws on Jarman’s beautiful memoir, ‘Modern Nature’, to recreate one year in the dream life of his garden and the stark landscape that surrounds it. With love and thanks to Christina Petrie. ",

      "This month’s` programme is an exploded view of one of our favourite pieces of music, The Incredible String Band’s ‘A Very Cellular Song’. The track, from the band’s 1968 masterpiece The Hangman’s Beautiful Daughter, is the loose inspiration for an hour of amoebas, early music and the mid-century Edinburgh literary avant-garde. With contributions from the ISB, David Attenborough, David Monrow and the Pinder Family.  ",
